# 📍 IS IT JUST ME?

## A Hyper-Local, Real-Time Issue Verification Platform

**IS IT JUST ME?** is a map-based community verification tool that helps residents quickly confirm whether others nearby are experiencing the same civic or utility issue — and automatically escalates verified problems to the right authorities.

Small problems shouldn’t stay invisible. This platform turns isolated frustrations into actionable community signals.

## 🚨 Problem

Many civic and infrastructure issues begin as *small, localized problems* — low water pressure, power flickers, potholes, internet outages. People often assume:

> “Maybe it’s just me.”

Because these issues are experienced in isolation, they go:

* Unreported
* Underreported
* Reported too late

There is currently **no simple, hyper-local, real-time system** that lets residents:

* Verify whether others nearby are experiencing the same issue
* Aggregate community confirmation
* Automatically escalate validated problems to authorities

---

## 💡 Solution

**IS IT JUST ME?** is a **hyper-local, map-based polling and issue validation platform**.

Users can:

1. Drop a pin at their location
2. Ask a **yes/no question** about a problem
3. Receive real-time community verification
4. Trigger automatic escalation when enough nearby users confirm

Example:

> “Is your internet down right now?”

If enough verified users say **yes**, the system flags the issue as **Verified** and alerts the relevant utility provider.

## ⭐ Core Features

### 1. Issue Creation & Polling

* Post specific, location-based issues
* Must be framed as a **yes/no question**
* Includes category, timestamp, severity

### 2. Location-Based Verification

* Votes counted only from users within a defined radius
* Radius varies by issue type
* Prevents trolling and false reports

### 3. Vote Threshold & Auto-Escalation

* Each issue has a minimum vote threshold
* Once reached:

  * Issue becomes **Verified**
  * Alerts sent via API, email, or dashboard

### 4. Issue Reposting & Persistence

* If unresolved or under-voted:

  * System reposts
  * Expands radius
  * Notifies nearby users again

### 5. Regional Bulletin Board

* Shows:

  * Most-voted issues
  * Unresolved issues
  * Emergency alerts
* Sortable by urgency, votes, time active

### 6. Range Control

* Users choose geographic impact:

  * Street
  * Neighborhood
  * District
  * City-wide

### 7. Authentication & Trust System

* Login via phone, email, or optional government ID
* Trust score increases with accurate participation

### 8. Emergency Mode (Low / No Internet)

* For fires, gas leaks, flooding, power failures
* Supports SMS/USSD posting
* Offline caching
* Emergency posts bypass thresholds

### 9. Severity Levels

| Level | Description         |
| ----- | ------------------- |
| 1     | Minor inconvenience |
| 2     | Ongoing disruption  |
| 3     | Safety concern      |
| 4     | Emergency           |

Higher levels require fewer votes and escalate faster.
